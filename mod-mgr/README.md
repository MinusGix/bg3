# BG3 Rust Mod Manager
This is a reimplementation of LaughingLeader's [BGModManager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager) in RUst.  
The primary goal for this is to be able to run it on Linux (and MacOS?) devices, since BG3ModManager uses WPF and I've struggled to get it running under wine.

## Implemented features
- Basic settings UI

## TODO
- Make sure that touch support works for steamdeck?

## Notable Missing Features
- Basically everything
- Screen reader support
